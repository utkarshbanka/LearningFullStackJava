==============
1) What is the need of Vcs?
2) How many types of Vcs?
    a)LCVS
    b) CVCS: svn;
    C) DVCS eg: Github,bitbucket,gitlab

Architecture of git
     a)Working area: Devleoper workspace(Source code);
     b) stage area;Before adding the code to the localrepository we keep the code in stage area
     c) Local Repositry;  Before pushing the code to remote repositry we keep the code in "Local Repository"

 What is git and github ?
 git-> It is a clinet tool where the user will enter url username and password of github repository;
 github-> It is a server where we keep repositores/projects which would be used for colloboration;

 
 git verson : to che check the git version;
 git help : if we want to see the list of commands then we can use git help;
  Note: This command is useful to get the the doucumnentaion of any command 
   eg: git help<Command namee>


3) git config:
    It is used when the git software is used for the first time
   The command will set the devleoper identity like name,emailid,
   This configuration information will be used by git software every push operation encounterd;
  
 git config --list =  check the list of configuration;

  To Set the username and email;
    > git config --global user.name "utkarshbanka"
      git config --global user.email "utkarsh.k.keshari@gmail.com"
      git config --global user.name "utkarshbanka"

       git config --list --show-origin //display the loacation of git configuration holded by git software;




 Important Operation associated with git ;
===============================================
git init 
===> Normally a folder will be created in the developers works place and inside the folder the source code would be place
    
  Why staging area;
     This command internally create one folder called .git;
     git  is used by git software to indentify the folder which should participate in pushing to "local" and "remote" repositry;
  

    Normally this is the first command which we execute to set up the git for operation like clone ,push,pull;
    
   Genrally git file is not showing that is created by git software to see this we click on view and show hidden file to see
  the hiden file in the folder;


To change the the directory use the following command cd..
  To check in which dirctory we use the command "Pwd" all the letter is case senstive ;

  git staging or localrepo;
                                    working ------ stageara ------ LocalRepository;

Git Status;
 This command is used to check the status  the working directory;

D:"Learn git\Workspace-1\github.txt;

On branch  master;
 untracked file ;
       
 git status : normally will give the ouputs in the following ways
   a)untracked file   it means the files are present still in working area and thes files can't be commited to "Local repositry not to remote reoposityr;(red in color);
   b) tracked file  : It means the files are moved from working area to stage area so these files can be commited to "local reoposity" and to "remote repositry"
   c) Modified files (red color) => it means the files are presnt sitll in working area and these files can be staged or int can also be restored 


 also possible to 

  git rm --cached github.txt ==== to reverse the file in working area ; move file to stage area to working area;

   git rm --cached <fileName>;


  if we want to to push all the files from worksape to stage area we use following command  

    synatax:
            git 

    
  The files which are ready for commit should be in stange area to perform commmit operation we use the following command 
synatax : git commit -m <some message>;


 eg git commit -m "Learn git";
   git commit -m "second commit" filename ; this will commit only that file into local repositry;


Step to followed to create a remote repositry and push it to remote repositry;
 
1) Open github.com;
2)Create a new repositry and enter some name (reposity name) and click on create repositry;
3)To peroform push operation we need to use the following command 
     

       git branch -M main 
       git remote add origin 


Fist clone the project in to workspace (copy of project that your Team lead created);(fist before working on the project);
init setup --
add--a;
commit --m "message"
push;

pull (lates change code will be pulled);
