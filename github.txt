     b) stage area;Before adding the code to the localrepository we keep the code in stage area
     c) Local Repositry;  Before pushing the code to remote repositry we keep the code in "Local Repository"

 What is git and github ?
 git-> It is a clinet tool where the user will enter url username and password of github repository;

 Important Operation associated with git ;
===============================================
git init 
===> Normally a folder will be created in the developers works place and inside the folder the source code would be place
    
  Why staging area;
     This command internally create one folder called .git;
     git  is used by git software to indentify the folder which should participate in pushing to "local" and "remote" repositry;
  

    Normally this is the first command which we execute to set up the git for operation like clone ,push,pull;
    
   Genrally git file is not showing that is created by git software to see this we click on view and show hidden file to see
  the hiden file in the folder;


To change the the directory use the following command cd..
  To check in which dirctory we use the command "Pwd" all the letter is case senstive ;
